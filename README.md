# 112th ATC In-Processing Guide
A step by step guide to inprocessing to the ATC.

## 1. Fort Liberty Reception Company
The first step is to report to the [XVIII Airborne Corps Reception Company](https://home.army.mil/liberty/my-fort/newcomers). You will have five days to complete the checklist they give to you. Everything on the checklist can be found in the [Soldier Support Center](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Parking+soldier+support+center/@35.1390073,-79.0050298,17z/data=!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x89ab6a229459ffcf:0x2e1cb21f19d0e915!2sFort+Liberty+Soldier+Support+Center!8m2!3d35.1389503!4d-79.0009689!16s%2Fg%2F1th64757!3m5!1s0x89ab6a17308beb39:0xa6e4521dad043023!8m2!3d35.138508!4d-79.0020004!16s%2Fg%2F11g698mmtk?entry=ttu), which is the large building off Normandy Drive right next to the Reception Company.

Once complete, turn in the checklist to the Reception Company and coordinate with your BN POC to arrive at the Battalion. 

## 2. Battalion In-Processing
### Setting up SOCOM account
1. Visit tech support personnel in the S-3 operations room to fill out the initial IMT-12 request for an account.
2. Visit the S-2 to receive their in-processing packet. They will require you to fill out and sign papers about handling classified and confidential information properly. They will also require you to complete a list of online trainings. Print the certificates and bring them back to the S-2 with the packet when complete.
3. Once S-2 processes the packet, return to the tech support personnel in the S-3 operations room.


## Lessons Learned
- You can hit all required briefs for the reception company in the soldier support center in 1 day.
