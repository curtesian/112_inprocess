# 112th ATC In-Processing Guide
A step by step guide to inprocessing to the ATC.

## 1. Fort Liberty Reception Company
The first step is to report to the [XVIII Airborne Corps Reception Company](https://home.army.mil/liberty/my-fort/newcomers). You will have five days to complete the checklist they give to you. Everything on the checklist can be found in the [Soldier Support Center](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Parking+soldier+support+center/@35.1390073,-79.0050298,17z/data=!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x89ab6a229459ffcf:0x2e1cb21f19d0e915!2sFort+Liberty+Soldier+Support+Center!8m2!3d35.1389503!4d-79.0009689!16s%2Fg%2F1th64757!3m5!1s0x89ab6a17308beb39:0xa6e4521dad043023!8m2!3d35.138508!4d-79.0020004!16s%2Fg%2F11g698mmtk?entry=ttu), which is the large building off Normandy Drive right next to the Reception Company.

Once complete, turn in the checklist to the Reception Company and coordinate with your BN POC to arrive at the Battalion.
